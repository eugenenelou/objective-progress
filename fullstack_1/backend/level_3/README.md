# Level 3 : Milestones

Users can now have more control over the expected completion of their objectives by creating milestones.

A milestone is a point with an accomplishment value and a date, by which the associated objective progression should pass.

The expected accomplishment between milestones (and between a milestone and one of the start or end point) is still linear.

The excess is still calculated with the expected completion at the date of a record, the value of this record and the starting point.
