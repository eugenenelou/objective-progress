# Level 4 : Top level objectives

In order to be aware of the global accomplishments of objectives, they can be linked to a `parent` objective.

Such a parent has its expected accomplishement deduced from the different objectives attached to it: the expected accomplishement at a certain date is the mean of the expected accomplishements of children objectives, taking into account some coefficients.

The start and end values of these objectives are also computed thanks to their children and corresponding coefficients.
